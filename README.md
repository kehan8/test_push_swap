# Push_swap Tester

Hello fellow programmers! ðŸ‘‹

I've created a testing script that simulates the evaluation process. This will help you estimate your potential project grade.

## Setup Instructions

1. Download the appropriate test script for your OS:
   ```bash
   # Choose one based on your OS:
   test_push_swap_linux.sh  # For Linux
   test_push_swap_mac.sh    # For macOS
   ```

2. Place the script in your push_swap project directory

3. Ensure you have the corresponding checker:
   ```bash
   checker_linux  # For Linux
   checker_mac    # For macOS
   ```

4. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   # For Linux
   chmod +x test_push_swap_linux.sh
   
   # For macOS
   chmod +x test_push_swap_mac.sh
   ```

5. Run the test:
   ```bash
   # For Linux
   ./test_push_swap_linux.sh
   
   # For macOS
   ./test_push_swap_mac.sh
   ```

## Features
- Tests various input sizes
- Checks operation counts
- Validates sorting correctness
- Provides grading feedback

Good luck with your push_swap project! ðŸš€
